# Technical Overview & Definitions
## Technical Diagram
To aid in understanding how `model-ensembler` works, **Figure 1** provides a visual overview of how 
the configuration and templates interact to generate our ensemble.

In green, Config and Templates are highlighted, these are the files that are changed by the user.

In gray, the different processes that are generated from the user files are shown. For example, the 
pre-processing tasks are controlled by the `pre-processing` section of the `config`, and `pre-run` scripts
within a batch are generated by a template called `pre-run.j2`.

The arrows indicate which process is generated from the respective config/template elements.

**Figure 1:** Visual overview of the definitions used throughout `model-ensembler` documentation. Boxes in green are edited by the user. Two batches are shown here for illustrative purposes.

As the user, you will be changing the Config and Templates to construct your ensemble.
How to do this is expanded on in the [Building Configuration](configuration.md) and [Building Templates](templates.md) sections.

## Definitions
Before reading these, an overview of definitions used throughout the documentation:

* **a run:** A run refers to the execution of a model, with a given set of parameters. A run will be submitted to an HPC backed (such as SLURM).
* **a batch:** We refer to the collection of model runs as a batch. `model-ensembler` can be used to configure a _single_ batch
or a _list_ of batches. The batch also includes common pre-and post **batch** tasks, which are common for all **runs** but not for all **batches**,
as well as pre-and post **run** tasks which are unique for each **run**.
* **pre-processing:** Common task(s) that are executed _before_ all **batch** execution.
* **post-processing:** Common task(s) that are executed _after_ all **batches** are completed.

Also note, not pictured:

* **a job:** Once a run has been submitted to an HPC backend (such as SLURM) as part of a batch, we define it as a job. It is distinguished from a run,
as `model-ensembler` enables configuration that can control the number of jobs that are executed concurrently on an HPC cluster. This is independent from the run configuration, and follows the [SLURM naming convention](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html).
