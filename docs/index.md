[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

`model-ensembler`is a tool to configure and automate running model ensembles on High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters.
It reduces the manual configuration of individual ensemble runs, by using a common configuration to individually generate templates
for each run.

It also provides pre-and post processing functionality to allow for common tasks to be applied to the ensemble, before
and after the individual runs. 

`model-ensembler` is developed to be extendable to various HPC backends, but currently it supports SLURM and running locally. 

## What is a model ensemble?

Can be multi-model, or the same model with different configuration/parameters.

## Why use `model-ensembler`?
Why should users use *this* tool.

The example in **Figure 1** is a simple example of an ensemble with just three models, but what if your ensemble has 10, 100 or
1000 models? Setting up the configuration for each ensemble member would bring significant manual overhead.

`model-ensembler` uses a single ensemble configuration file, in the form of a `.yml` file, and a collection of
[jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) templates to control your ensemble and dynamically generate
a batch (or batches) of model runs.

This design means writing a `config.yml` and corresponding templates just once, and intents to give provide flexibility and enable a 
wide range of applications.

## Examples and Testimonials
Example configurations and templates are provided under `examples/`, and documented under [Example Section](user/example1.md) (to be renamed).

Also take a look at the [testimonials](testimonials.md) page to get a flavour of the types of model ensembles `model-ensembler` has been used for.
