# model-ensembler
This is a tool to assist users in running model ensembles on HPCs, potentially 
in conjunction with other external systems. It will be easy to be extend for 
various other HPC backends (currently just SLURM is supported), as well as 
being easy to extend code wise for new tasks that support the ensemble 
workflows.
